For ten years now, YouTube has continued to grow as the number one site for online videos. Millions of creators from around the world contribute non-stop to its seemingly endless library of videos: more than ten days worth of videos are uploaded every minute. As a result, probing the depths, and even the surface, of the site to find content that might interest you can be a huge undertaking, to the point that some people might give up before even starting.

There are currently just over 50 French YouTubers with over a million subscribers, three of whom appeared in the [2015 YouTube Rewind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK9bwTlAvgo) (two more than in [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKx2B8WCQuw)) and we can expect countless more to break the big million in the coming weeks and months.

Personally, I am a big fan of YouTube and spend many hours every day on the platform watching videos and looking for new and exciting creators. So, in the interest of saving you all some time, I’ve created a huge list of 70+ of the biggest and most creative YouTubers from the French speaking world.

Without further ado, here is my list of the biggest, best and most interesting YouTubers from the Francophonie!

And, just for fun, here's a quick list of some of my all-time favourite videos.

*   [Usul Passion : Don't Starve](https://youtu.be/z7mWih6hCyY) - A man playing a game of Don't Starve with a very "literary" commentary. A good watch if your vocabulary is up to snuff.
*   [Point Culture : Introduction à la musique "classique"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clRUz4piR3s) - Don't know much about classical music? Didn't know that "classical" is actually a period and not an all-encompassing genre? This is for you!
*   [Voyage mère/fille en Pologne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j8G7SoxeqY) - Vlog in Poland with Natoo.
*   [Les dragons pourraient-ils cracher du feu ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpmrR7HBNh8) - A biologist's take on whether or not animals could evolve to breathe fire.
*   [Les Français sont-ils racistes ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Pi-lc_KL0) - Ludovik goes around having extremely awkward interviews with random people. Not to be taken seriously.
*   [TUTO OEUF MAYO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHdgXkkVyl0) - The Grand Finale Of "Les Tutos". Much silliness.
*   [Gonzague s'incruste aux NRJ Music Awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUVZPtjrFo) - My personal favourite from Gonzague.

> Sizen is a 22-year-old student from Western Canada, [a forum member](http://forum.language-learners.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=347) who's dabbled in over a dozen languages who describes himself: I'm half Quebecois, but I didn't inherit my father's native tongue as I grew up speaking only English at home. My parents did, however, put me in Early French Immersion when it was time to send me to school; I just didn't start taking my French studies seriously until after high school. YouTube has always played an important role in my life and my language studies.
