# Our blog

This is all the content for our blog.  We render it using [Jekyll][], which
generates a static site for performance and security.  GitHub automatically
renders the blog for us, and serves it, too.

The older content was imported from WordPress, and it's in HTML format.
All new content should probably be written using [Markdown][] and stored in
files with the extension `*.md`.

## An important note about copyright

Unless indicated otherwise, the older articles on this blog are copyrighted
by their authors, and you'll have to ask rdearman about the licenses.

The files:

- `_includes/header.html`
- `_includes/footer.html`

...were copied from [the minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima),
and are copyright ????-2017 by the minima contributors.  They are
distributed under the MIT license, included as `MIT-LICENSE.txt`.

## Dev notes: Accessing the old site

See [the Wayback Machine][old] if you want to know what the WordPress site
looked like.  This shows the links, etc., to other sites, and the actual
posts available.

The RSS should be placed at `/feed/`.
